This repository contains the code for statistical analyses performed in Chapter 3 of my thesis "Cross-sectional and longitudinal profiling of PD transcriptomics and metabolomics".
The project consists on whole blood transcriptomics and blood plasma metabolomics cross-sectional and longitudinal profiling of Parkinson's disease patients and controls from the PPMI cohort and  the LuxPARK cohort respectively, to identify differential molecular and higher-level functional features in PD.

ppmi_analyses contains code related to analysis on transcriptomics data from PPMI.

luxpark_analyses contains code related to analysis on metabolomics data from LuxPARK.

There is a README.md inside each directory with corresponding explanation for each script.
